## Publishing Visualizations in R with Shiny and flexdashboard

This repo contains my solution to the three programming assignments of this
course. The R code I wrote to create the Shiny Apps can be found here:

1. [Your First Shiny App](https://github.com/mwoitek/r-shiny-flexdashboard/blob/master/assignment_1/app.R)
1. [A (Much) More Complex Shiny App](https://github.com/mwoitek/r-shiny-flexdashboard/blob/master/assignment_2/app.R)
1. [Making a Dashboard](https://github.com/mwoitek/r-shiny-flexdashboard/blob/master/assignment_3/c4_peer3_solution.Rmd)

The links to the corresponding apps are listed below:
